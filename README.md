## 📕 Notes
This website is for demo purposes and is intended as a proof of concept for an interview with the MLB. This product is not officially affilated with the MLB. 
The website simulates AI with web scraping and parsing. Replacing actual responses with a trained AI model with real-time data integration would be the intended endgoal of this application.
